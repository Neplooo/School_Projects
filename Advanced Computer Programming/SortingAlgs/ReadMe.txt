COMMENTS: This assignment was turned in lated due to my planned excused absense from GSSM to
go to the FTC robotics world championship. As stated in the student handbook, I have 5 school
days upon my return to GSSM to complete overdue assignments.
REFLECTION: This assignment took me around 2-3 hours to complete. The difficult part of this assignment was 
understanding how the various sorting algorithms worked. After I was able to conceptually understand them,
I was able to write them into code without much issue.
