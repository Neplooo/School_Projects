REFLECTION: This assignment took me about 2-3 hours to complete. While none of it was "difficult",
I found many of the tasks difficult to understand due to the wording. However, as I read it multiple
times over, I was able to figure it out. Reading the input file in java was also not necessarly an easy
task, however I was able to figure it out through the help section of the assignment.
