REFLECTION: This assignment took me around 6 hours to complete. While it started off slow with me
not knowing what to do, I quickly was able to figure it out as I started getting help from some 
people and most importantly, writing down the mazes on paper. I had some problems with the logic of my if
else statement and boolean algebra, however, with some testing, I was able to figure it out.
