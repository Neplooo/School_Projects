REFLECTION: This project took me about 4 hours to complete. The major problem I had with this project
was that I thought that the stack was supposed to contain the entire calculation before solving this.
I overcame the problem by realizing that the stack should only contain numbers that are going to be 
operated on in the next two iterations.
